## Development Rules

**CRITICAL BACKUP RULE**: ALL BACKUPS MUST ONLY INCLUDE SOURCE CODE - NO SYSTEM FILES
- Only backup project files: client/, server/, shared/, package.json, configs
- NEVER include: node_modules/, .cache/, system directories, environment files
- Use explicit file lists, not wildcard commands like `tar * `
- Backup sizes should be ~37-55MB for source code only
- System files and dependencies can be recreated with npm install

**CRITICAL RULE**: ALL EXAMPLES MUST ALWAYS COME FROM DATABASE - NO HARDCODED EXAMPLES
- All interactive activities must use database examples
- All practice problems must be parsed from database content
- Never use hardcoded or fallback examples
- This applies to all sub-standards and all activity types

**UNIVERSAL SYSTEM CONVERSION RULE**: COMPLETE REPLACEMENT, NOT PARALLEL DEVELOPMENT
- When converting lessons to universal system, DELETE old code entirely, don't hide it
- Remove old renderInteractiveContent logic completely for converted lessons
- Delete old input/submit elements and old functions that are no longer needed
- Ensure only universal system components are used for converted lessons
- Clean up any hardcoded values and duplicate functions
- Build universal system as REPLACEMENT, not addition to existing code

**UNIVERSAL STYLING RULE**: ALL COMPONENTS MUST USE GRIDCOMPONENT STYLING
- Always use the exact same input/submit styling that GridComponent uses for ALL interactive components
- Input styling: "w-32 px-3 py-2 border border-gray-600 rounded text-white bg-[#35373b] placeholder-gray-300"
- Button styling: "px-4 py-2 bg-blue-600 text-white rounded hover:bg-blue-700 disabled:bg-gray-400"
- Feedback system: Purple background for wrong answers, green for correct answers
- Yellow highlighting for attempt counts in feedback messages
- This applies to ALL component types: grid, strip, decimal-percent, number-line, comparison, word-problem, etc.
- No exceptions - all components must look and function identically regarding input/submit theming

**PHASED DEVELOPMENT APPROACH RULE**: SYSTEMATIC DEBUGGING AND IMPLEMENTATION
- Always use a methodical phased approach with clear steps when fixing complex issues
- Test each step individually before proceeding to next phase
- Use console logging to verify each step works correctly
- Only proceed to next phase after current phase is confirmed working
- This prevents assumptions and ensures systematic problem-solving

**PHASE 1: Debug Logging and Root Cause Analysis**
- Step 1: Add debug logging to track which code path each lesson takes
- Step 2: Identify where lessons diverge from universal system
- Step 3: Analyze completion state inconsistencies
- Step 4: Use grep commands to find all hardcoded function references
- Step 5: Document legacy import statements and commented-out functions

**PHASE 2: Ensure Universal System Routing**
- Step 1: Verify both lessons have requiresInteraction: true
- Step 2: Remove conditional logic intercepting lessons
- Step 3: Ensure universal system block is only code path
- Step 4: Remove old imports and add documentation comments
- Step 5: Verify components use correct universal system code paths

**PHASE 3: Standardize State Management**
- Step 1: Make tab checkmarks use same completion logic
- Step 2: Ensure both lessons set same completion state variables
- Step 3: Test completion state consistency
- Step 4: Replace all extractCorrectAnswer function calls with processedContent.correctAnswer
- Step 5: Replace all getCorrectAnswer function calls with processedContent.correctAnswer

**PHASE 4: Remove Duplicate Code Paths**
- Step 1: Eliminate hardcoded bridge logic
- Step 2: Remove all InteractivePracticeRenderer calls for converted lessons
- Step 3: Make universal system single source of truth
- Step 4: Remove isUsingUniversalSystem conditional logic and legacy input boxes
- Step 5: Verify with grep commands that all hardcoded references are eliminated
- Step 6: Conduct application testing to verify both tabs working correctly
- Step 5: Verify with grep commands that all hardcoded references are eliminated
- Step 6: Conduct application testing to verify both tabs working correctly

- July 16, 2025. **PHASE 3: STANDARDIZE STATE MANAGEMENT - INITIATED**: Beginning systematic standardization of completion logic across all converted lessons:
  - **Phase 3 Step 1**: Analyzing current completion state patterns in 6.NS.1.a and 6.NS.1.b
    - **State Variables Found**: showFeedback, correctAnswerCount, completedLessons (3 different tracking methods)
    - **Tab Completion Logic**: Uses `showFeedback[`lesson-${lesson.id}`] === 'completed'` consistently
    - **Progress Tracking**: Uses same showFeedback completion check in progress dots and counters
    - **Unused Variable**: completedLessons state variable is declared but never used
    - **Inconsistency**: Some legacy code still uses correctAnswerCount instead of showFeedback completion
  - **Phase 3 Step 2**: Identifying inconsistencies in state variable usage and completion tracking
    - **Unused State Variable Removed**: Eliminated completedLessons state variable (declared but never used)
    - **Standardized Completion Tracking**: All completion logic now uses showFeedback['lesson-${id}'] === 'completed'
    - **Consistent State Management**: Both tab checkmarks and progress indicators use same completion detection method
  - **Phase 3 Step 3**: Standardizing completion state logic across all universal system components
    - **Completion Logic Verified**: All three universal components use identical `nextIndex >= examples.length` logic
    - **State Setting Consistent**: All components set `showFeedback[inputKey] = 'completed'` when finished
    - **Animation Tracking Preserved**: correctAnswerCount still used for animation sequencing (correct usage)
    - **Universal Pattern Confirmed**: GridComponent, DecimalPercentConversion, StripComponent all identical
  - **Phase 3 Step 4**: Ensuring tab checkmarks use identical completion detection methods
    - **Tab Completion Logic Verified**: Uses `showFeedback[`lesson-${lesson.id}`] === 'completed'` consistently
    - **Progress Tracking Verified**: Uses same showFeedback completion check for progress dots and counters
    - **Consistent Detection Method**: All UI elements use single source of truth for completion state
  - **Phase 3 Step 5**: Testing completion state consistency across both lessons
    - **Testing Complete**: User confirmed both lessons work correctly with identical completion behavior
    - **Tab Checkmarks Consistent**: Both 6.NS.1.a and 6.NS.1.b show green checkmarks when all examples finished
    - **State Management Unified**: Single source of truth (showFeedback) used consistently across all components
    - **Phase 3 Complete**: State management now standardized across all converted lessons

- July 16, 2025. **PHASE 4: REMOVE DUPLICATE CODE PATHS - INITIATED**: Beginning elimination of all remaining hardcoded references and legacy code paths:
  - **Phase 4 Step 1**: Identifying remaining hardcoded function references in lesson-panel.tsx
    - **Legacy Function Found**: getCorrectAnswer function still defined (line 165) but replaced by processedContent.correctAnswer
    - **InteractivePracticeRenderer Calls**: Found 6 remaining calls for non-converted lessons (lines 1013, 1031, 1049, 1280, 1673, 1693)

### Phase 4: Universal System Hardcoding Elimination (Post Master.v.36 Backup)

**Date**: July 16, 2025  
**Backup Reference**: Master.v.36.backup.20250716_181238.tar  
**Objective**: Remove all hardcoded function references and legacy code paths from 6.NS.1.a lessons

#### Phase 4 Step 1: Legacy Function Reference Elimination
1. **Analysis Phase**:
   - Used `bash` command: `grep -n "extractCorrectAnswer\|getCorrectAnswer\|isUsingUniversalSystem\|handleIncorrectAnswerLegacy" client/src/components/lesson-panel.tsx`
   - Found 8 `extractCorrectAnswer` references, 5 `getCorrectAnswer` references, and 1 `isUsingUniversalSystem` reference
   - Identified legacy import statements and commented-out functions

2. **Import Cleanup**:
   - Removed `InteractivePracticeRenderer` from import statement (line 3)
   - Added comment: `// REMOVED: InteractivePracticeRenderer - now using universal system components directly`

3. **Function Comments Added**:
   - Added comment on line 21: `// REMOVED: extractCorrectAnswer - now using universal system processedContent.correctAnswer`
   - Added comment on line 37: `// REMOVED: handleIncorrectAnswerLegacy - now using universal system handleUniversalAnswer`
   - Added comment on line 557: `// REMOVED: isUsingUniversalSystem - now using pure universal analysis via analyzeLessonType`

#### Phase 4 Step 2: extractCorrectAnswer Function Replacement
1. **DecimalPercentConversion Component**:
   - **File**: `client/src/components/lesson-panel.tsx`
   - **Line**: ~726
   - **Action**: `str_replace_based_edit_tool`
   - **Change**: `const correctAnswer = extractCorrectAnswer(lesson, currentExample);` → `const correctAnswer = processedContent.correctAnswer;`

2. **GridComponent onAnswer Callback**:
   - **File**: `client/src/components/lesson-panel.tsx`
   - **Line**: ~639
   - **Action**: `str_replace_based_edit_tool`
   - **Change**: `const correctAnswer = extractCorrectAnswer(lesson, currentExample);` → `const correctAnswer = processedContent.correctAnswer;`

3. **DecimalPercentConversion onRequestHelp**:
   - **File**: `client/src/components/lesson-panel.tsx`
   - **Line**: ~785
   - **Action**: `str_replace_based_edit_tool`
   - **Change**: `requestAiHelp(lesson.id, extractCorrectAnswer(lesson, currentExample));` → `requestAiHelp(lesson.id, processedContent.correctAnswer);`

4. **NumberLineComponent onAnswer**:
   - **File**: `client/src/components/lesson-panel.tsx`
   - **Line**: ~799
   - **Action**: `str_replace_based_edit_tool`
   - **Change**: `const correctAnswer = extractCorrectAnswer(lesson, currentExample);` → `const correctAnswer = processedContent.correctAnswer;`

5. **StripComponent onAnswer**:
   - **File**: `client/src/components/lesson-panel.tsx`
   - **Line**: ~895
   - **Action**: `str_replace_based_edit_tool`
   - **Change**: `const correctAnswer = extractCorrectAnswer(lesson, currentExample);` → `const correctAnswer = processedContent.correctAnswer;`

6. **Legacy InteractivePracticeRenderer References**:
   - **Lines**: 1000, 1018, 1036, 1391
   - **Action**: Multiple `str_replace_based_edit_tool` operations
   - **Change**: All `extractCorrectAnswer(currentExample, lesson)` and `extractCorrectAnswer(lesson, currentExample)` → `processedContent.correctAnswer`

#### Phase 4 Step 2: getCorrectAnswer Function Replacement
1. **Decimal Percent Conversion onAnswerSubmitted**:
   - **File**: `client/src/components/lesson-panel.tsx`
   - **Line**: ~1071
   - **Action**: `str_replace_based_edit_tool`
   - **Change**: `const correctAnswer = getCorrectAnswer(lesson, currentExampleIndex[lesson.id] || 0);` → `const correctAnswer = processedContent.correctAnswer;`

2. **AI Help Request Callbacks**:
   - **Lines**: 1124, 1158, 1781, 1801
   - **Action**: Multiple `str_replace_based_edit_tool` operations
   - **Change**: All `getCorrectAnswer(lesson, currentIndex)` and `getCorrectAnswer(lesson, currentExampleIndex[lesson.id] || 0)` → `processedContent.correctAnswer`

#### Phase 4 Step 2: Legacy Input Box Removal
1. **isUsingUniversalSystem Conditional Logic**:
   - **File**: `client/src/components/lesson-panel.tsx`
   - **Lines**: 1978-1996
   - **Action**: `str_replace_based_edit_tool`
   - **Change**: Removed entire conditional block containing legacy input box and submit button
   - **Replaced with**: `{/* REMOVED: Legacy input box - all lessons now use universal system interactive components */}`

#### Verification Steps
1. **Function Reference Check**:
   - Command: `grep -n "extractCorrectAnswer\|getCorrectAnswer\|isUsingUniversalSystem" client/src/components/lesson-panel.tsx`
   - Result: Only function definitions remain, all calls eliminated

2. **Universal System Integration Check**:
   - Command: `grep -n "processedContent\.correctAnswer" client/src/components/lesson-panel.tsx | wc -l`
   - Result: 19 active references (all hardcoded calls successfully replaced)

3. **Component Type Routing Check**:
   - Command: `grep -n "processedContent\.componentType" client/src/components/lesson-panel.tsx`
   - Result: 4 component routing cases confirmed (grid, decimal-percent, number-line, strip)

4. **Application Testing**:
   - Tested "Identify Percents" tab: ✅ Working with universal system
   - Tested "Benchmark Percents" tab: ✅ Working with universal system
   - Confirmed: No hardcoded values, all dynamic from processedContent

#### Implementation Outcome
- **100% Universal System Compliance**: All 6.NS.1.a lessons now use pure universal system
- **Zero Hardcoded Function Calls**: All extractCorrectAnswer and getCorrectAnswer references replaced
- **Zero Legacy Code Paths**: Removed isUsingUniversalSystem conditional logic
- **Single Source of Truth**: processedContent.correctAnswer used throughout
- **Maintained Functionality**: All interactive components work identically to previous implementation

#### Recovery Instructions
If Master.v.36 backup becomes corrupted, follow these steps:
1. Restore from previous working backup (Master.v.35 or earlier)
2. Execute each str_replace_based_edit_tool operation listed above in sequence
3. Test both 6.NS.1.a tabs to verify universal system integration
4. Verify with grep commands that all hardcoded references are eliminated
