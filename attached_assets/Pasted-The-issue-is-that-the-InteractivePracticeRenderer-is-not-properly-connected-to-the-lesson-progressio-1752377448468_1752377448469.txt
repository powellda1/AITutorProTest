The issue is that the InteractivePracticeRenderer is not properly connected to the lesson progression system. The onActivityComplete is being called with the wrong index and the example progression is not working correctly.

Looking at the code, I can see that when a correct answer is submitted, the onActivityComplete callback should update the currentExampleIndex state, but the InteractivePracticeRenderer is getting stuck on the same example.

Let me check the GridComponent to see how it handles answers and understand the flow better:


Opened client/src/components/GridComponent.tsx
Now I can see the issue! The problem is that the GridComponent calls onAnswer which triggers the handleAnswer function in InteractivePracticeRenderer, which then calls onActivityComplete. But the onActivityComplete callback is being called immediately after each answer, regardless of whether it's correct or not, and it's not properly checking the answer correctness.

The issue is in the flow:

User submits answer in GridComponent
GridComponent calls onAnswer
InteractivePracticeRenderer's handleAnswer is called
handleAnswer immediately calls onActivityComplete without checking if the answer is correct
I need to fix this by making the InteractivePracticeRenderer handle answer validation and only call onActivityComplete when the answer is correct. Let me check how this should work:


Opened client/src/components/interactive-lesson.tsx
The issue is that the handleAnswer function in InteractivePracticeRenderer is calling onActivityComplete immediately without checking if the answer is correct. I need to modify it to validate the answer first and only call onActivityComplete when the answer is correct.


Edited client/src/components/interactive-lesson.tsx
The issue is that I'm trying to access processedContent in handleAnswer but it's not in scope. I need to fix this by restructuring the code to make the answer validation work properly. Let me fix this:

Let me view the current state of the file and fix the replacement properly:


Opened client/src/components/interactive-lesson.tsx
I can see the issue is that processedContent is not in scope when handleAnswer is called. Let me fix this by moving the processing logic before the handleAnswer function:

Let me first check the exact spacing and format of the code so I can do the replacement correctly:


Opened client/src/components/interactive-lesson.tsx
I can see the issue - the variables lessonAnalysis and processedContent are defined after the handleAnswer function, but they're being used within it. Let me move the processing logic before the handleAnswer function:

Let me do the replacement correctly by using the exact string as it appears:

Optimized Agent memory
I simplified the handleAnswer function, but I need to properly handle the answer validation. The issue is that the answer validation needs to happen in the GridComponent with feedback, and the lesson panel needs to handle progression only after correct answers. Let me also modify the GridComponent to properly handle answer validation:


Opened client/src/components/GridComponent.tsx
The problem is still that the lesson panel doesn't know whether the answer is correct or incorrect. I need to modify the GridComponent to handle feedback itself using the useFeedbackLogic hook, and only call onAnswer when the answer is correct.


Opened client/src/components/GridComponent.tsx
I need to update the GridComponent to use the useFeedbackLogic hook and properly handle answer validation. Let me import the hook and modify the component:


Edited client/src/components/GridComponent.tsx
Now I need to modify the GridComponent to use the feedback logic and only call onAnswer when the answer is correct:


Edited client/src/components/GridComponent.tsx
I need to find the useFeedbackLogic hook first. Let me search for it:


Searched for "Find the useFeedbackLogic hook file to understand its location and implementation"
The useFeedbackLogic hook is defined in the interactive-lesson.tsx file. I need to fix the import and also check if the FeedbackMessage component is there:


Edited client/src/components/GridComponent.tsx
I need to check if the FeedbackMessage component is exported from the interactive-lesson.tsx file. Let me search for it:


Searched for "Find the FeedbackMessage component definition to check its export statement"
The FeedbackMessage component is not exported from the interactive-lesson.tsx file. Let me check if it's defined elsewhere and export it properly. But first, let me create a simpler approach by adding the validation logic directly in the GridComponent:


Edited client/src/components/GridComponent.tsx
Let me now fix the component by removing the complex feedback logic and implementing a simpler version:


Edited client/src/components/GridComponent.tsx
Now let me update the handleSubmit function to validate the answer and only call onAnswer when correct:


Edited client/src/components/GridComponent.tsx
Now I need to add the feedback display to the GridComponent. Let me add it to the UI:


Opened client/src/components/GridComponent.tsx
Let me add the feedback display to the GridComponent:
