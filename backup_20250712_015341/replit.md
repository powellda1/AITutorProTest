# Math Tutoring AI Application

## Overview

This is a full-stack math tutoring application that combines AI-powered assistance with structured curriculum learning. The application features an interactive chat interface where students can ask math questions and receive AI-generated responses, along with a structured lesson system for guided learning.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom dark theme
- **UI Components**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui component library
- **State Management**: React Query (@tanstack/react-query) for server state
- **Routing**: Wouter for client-side routing
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express server
- **Language**: TypeScript with ES modules
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Database Provider**: Neon Database (@neondatabase/serverless)
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API for math tutoring responses
- **Session Management**: Database-backed storage with PostgreSQL
- **Curriculum Storage**: Database-driven with structured schema for educational standards

### Key Components

1. **Curriculum Tree** - Hierarchical lesson organization with expandable categories
2. **Lesson Panel** - Displays structured lesson content with math expressions
3. **Chat Interface** - Real-time messaging with AI tutor
4. **AI Response Panel** - Dedicated space for displaying AI explanations and examples
5. **Resizable Layout** - Draggable dividers for customizable workspace

## Data Flow

1. **Lesson Loading**: Frontend queries `/api/lessons` endpoints to populate curriculum tree
2. **Chat Interaction**: User messages are sent to `/api/chat` which triggers OpenAI API calls
3. **AI Processing**: OpenAI responds with structured JSON containing response, explanation, and examples
4. **Real-time Updates**: React Query manages cache invalidation and real-time UI updates
5. **Session Management**: Each chat session is tracked with unique session IDs

## External Dependencies

### AI Services
- **OpenAI API**: GPT-4o model for math tutoring responses
- **Configuration**: Uses environment variable `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- **Response Format**: Structured JSON with response, explanation, and examples fields

### Database
- **Neon Database**: Serverless PostgreSQL database
- **Connection**: Uses `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- **Schema Management**: Drizzle migrations in `/migrations` directory

### UI Framework
- **Radix UI**: Comprehensive set of accessible UI primitives
- **shadcn/ui**: Pre-built components with consistent styling
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling with custom CSS variables

## Deployment Strategy

### Development
- **Dev Server**: Vite development server with HMR
- **API Server**: Express server with TypeScript compilation via tsx
- **Database**: Drizzle push for schema synchronization

### Production
- **Build Process**: Vite builds frontend, esbuild bundles backend
- **Static Assets**: Served from `/dist/public` directory
- **API Routes**: Express server handles `/api/*` routes
- **Database**: Automated migrations via Drizzle

### Environment Variables
- `DATABASE_URL`: PostgreSQL connection string
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: OpenAI API authentication
- `NODE_ENV`: Environment mode (development/production)

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## Development Rules

**CRITICAL RULE**: ALL EXAMPLES MUST ALWAYS COME FROM DATABASE - NO HARDCODED EXAMPLES
- All interactive activities must use database examples
- All practice problems must be parsed from database content
- Never use hardcoded or fallback examples
- This applies to all sub-standards and all activity types
